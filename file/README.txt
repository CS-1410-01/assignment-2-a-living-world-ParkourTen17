This is my Final Assignment for CS 1410, I hope you enjoy!
It's based off of ecosystem found in Earth's during the Paleozoic era, featuring a lot of creatures that are now extinct.
I chose this style because I'm a geology major taking paleontology this semester, and we learned about this environment and creatures in class.

The four creatures in this simulation are corals, trilobites, sea scorpions, and ammonites.
Each have a different speed that they move around and rate at which they die:
for example, corals don't move at all but die slowly, while trilobites move slowly but are particularly productive in their reproduction.

When you start the program, it will ask you to enter the size of the world in the X and Y directions, 
then it will fill that world with a certain number of creatures and food proportional to the overall size of the world.
    A = Ammonite
    S = Sea Scorpion
    T = Trilobite
    C = Coral
    * = Food
You press enter to move through one step of the world, type print to print out statistics about the creatures, and type stop to quit.

Each creature can move around randomly on each step, and has the possibility of running into food and eating it.
If they do, they reproduce, and another creature of that same type spawns in the same location.
Each creature also has a small chance of dying on each step.
Ammonites and Sea Scorpions also eat trilobites if they land on it, and they can reproduce that way.
The number of food in the world usually depends on how many creatures are alive and eating it, 
and too many creatures in the simulation may lead to not enough food to support the population, leading to a mass die-off.

I hope you have fun playing around with the size of the world and watching what creatures eventually dominate.
